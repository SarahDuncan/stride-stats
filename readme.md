# ASP.NET Core Web API consuming the Strava API

Includes:
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- Unit tests with xUnit
- Integration tests with xUnit and WireMock.Net
- BDD tests with Specflow (Reqnroll + NUnit + Gherkin + WireMock.Net)

I did this project to practice setting up an API proj with middleware etc on my own (outside of the workplace where we inevitably end up just extending existing projects), and get experience working with different types of testing and testing frameworks.
